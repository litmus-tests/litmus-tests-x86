# litmus-tests-x86

This litmus-tests-riscv repository contains litmus tests for the
x86 concurrency architecture.

Most or all of the litmus tests have been automatically generated using the
diy and diyone test generators from the diy tool suite <http://diy.inria.fr>;
any others are hand-written.  The tests are in the form used both by that
tool suite (which also includes the litmus tool for running tests on
hardware and the herd tool for running tests in axiomatic models) and
by the rmem tool <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem>, for
running tests in operational models.

The tests are distributed subject to the BSD 2-clause licence below.
